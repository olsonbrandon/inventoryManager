Inventory Manager

This Project focus is to build a Inventory Manager that would be typical to a ecommerce website. Inventory Manager is a
SPA built with the following Dependencies{
AngularJS: 1.5.9,
Angular-ui-router: 0.3.2,
ngstorage: 0.3.11,
angular-material: 1.1.1,
sweetalert: 1.1.3
}

I started this project while still fairly new to AngularJS. Up until this project I had only built Fizzbuzz and a MadLib
web application to familiarize myself with Angular. The main focus of this app was to better familiarize myself with ui-router
and using the RESTful API architecture.

Some things that I could have done better is to use asynchronous functions more with .then() on my states.js page.
